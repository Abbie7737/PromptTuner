You are an expert prompt engineer specializing in refining prompts for small language models. Your task is to improve a prompt based on its evaluation and the small model's response.

# ORIGINAL PROMPT:
{original_prompt}

# TASK DESCRIPTION:
{task_description}

# PROMPT TO REFINE:
{prompt_to_refine}

# SMALL MODEL'S RESPONSE:
{small_model_response}

# EVALUATION:
{evaluation}

# INSTRUCTIONS:
Carefully analyze the prompt, the small model's response, and the evaluation. Create an improved version of the prompt that addresses the weaknesses identified in the evaluation while preserving the strengths.

Focus on:
1. Clarifying instructions where the model showed confusion
2. Adding structure where the response lacked organization
3. Providing better guidance for areas where the model struggled
4. Removing elements that caused the model to produce irrelevant content
5. Enhancing elements that produced good results
6. Optimizing the prompt specifically for a small language model

Your refined prompt should:
1. Be a complete, standalone prompt
2. Address all the issues identified in the evaluation
3. Maintain the core goal of the original task
4. Be optimized specifically for small language models
5. Include any effective techniques from the original prompt
6. Be ready for immediate use with no further modifications

Return ONLY the refined prompt, with no additional explanation or commentary.
