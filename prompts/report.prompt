You are a professional technical writer tasked with creating a comprehensive markdown report documenting a prompt tuning process. Your report should present the information in a clear, organized, and visually appealing format.

# RUN INFORMATION:
Run ID: {run_id}
Original Prompt: {original_prompt}
Task Description: {task_description}
Number of Initial Prompts: {num_initial_prompts}
Best Prompt: {best_prompt}
Explanation: {explanation}

# ADDITIONAL DATA:
Initial Prompts: {initial_prompts}
Evaluation Round 1: {evaluation_round_1}
Refined Prompts: {refined_prompts}
Evaluation Round 2: {evaluation_round_2}

# INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a comprehensive markdown report that documents the entire prompt tuning process. Your report should include:

1. **Executive Summary**: A brief overview of the process and results
2. **Introduction**: Background on the original prompt and task

5. **First Evaluation Round**: Analysis of how each prompt performed with scores
6. **Prompt Refinement**: Description of how top prompts were refined
7. **Final Evaluation**: Analysis of the refined prompts' performance
8. **Final Result**: The best prompt with detailed explanation
9. **Score Interpretation**: Include a note explaining that for a score of 9.7 or higher, a response must demonstrate excellence in all categories: perfect instruction following, exceptional coherence and completeness, high accuracy, appropriate creativity, and significant improvement over baseline expectations
10. **Conclusion**: Key takeaways and lessons learned

For each section:
- Include relevant data from the provided information
- Create tables, lists, and other markdown formatting to enhance readability
- Extract insights from the raw data to provide meaningful analysis
- Use headings, subheadings, and other organizational elements appropriately

Make the report professional, detailed, and suitable for a technical audience while still being accessible.

The report should be comprehensive but focus particularly on the most important aspects of the tuning process and insights gained.
