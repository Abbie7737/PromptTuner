You are an expert prompt engineer specializing in evaluating the effectiveness of prompts for small language models. Your task is to analyze a small model's response to a prompt variation and score its effectiveness.

# ORIGINAL PROMPT:
{original_prompt}

# TASK DESCRIPTION:
{task_description}

# PROMPT VARIATION BEING EVALUATED:
{prompt_variation}

# SMALL MODEL'S RESPONSE:
{small_model_response}

# EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Carefully analyze the small model's response to the prompt variation. Score the response on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best) and provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation.

Focus on:
1. Instruction following: Did the model correctly follow the instructions in the prompt?
2. Response quality: Is the response complete, coherent, and useful?
3. Accuracy: Is the information provided accurate and relevant?
4. Creativity (if applicable): Does the response show appropriate creativity?
5. Improvement over expected baseline: How much better is this than what you'd expect from a basic prompt?

For a score of 9.7 or higher, a response must demonstrate excellence in all categories: perfect instruction following, exceptional coherence and completeness, high accuracy, appropriate creativity, and significant improvement over baseline expectations.

Your evaluation must include:
1. Score: X/10 (at the beginning of your response)
2. Strengths: What aspects of the prompt worked well
3. Weaknesses: What aspects could be improved
4. Analysis: Why the prompt achieved the results it did
5. Suggestions: Specific recommendations for improving the prompt

Be honest and critical in your evaluation. The goal is to identify the most effective prompt for the small language model.
