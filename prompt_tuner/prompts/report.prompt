You are a professional technical writer tasked with creating a comprehensive markdown report documenting a prompt tuning process. Your report should present the information in a clear, organized, and visually appealing format.

# RUN INFORMATION:
Run ID: {run_id}
Original Prompt: {original_prompt}
Task Description: {task_description}
Number of Initial Prompts: {num_initial_prompts}
Best Prompt: {best_prompt}
Explanation: {explanation}
Best Initial Score: {best_initial_score}
Best Refined Score: {best_refined_score}
Best Round: {best_round}

# ADDITIONAL DATA:
Initial Prompts: {initial_prompts}
Evaluation Round 1: {evaluation_round_1}
Refined Prompts: {refined_prompts}
Evaluation Round 2: {evaluation_round_2}

# INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a comprehensive markdown report that documents the entire prompt tuning process. Your report should include:

1. **Executive Summary**: A brief overview of the process and results
2. **Introduction**: Background on the original prompt and task
3. **Methodology**: Explanation of the prompt tuning approach
4. **Initial Prompt Generation**: Overview of the generated prompts
5. **First Evaluation Round**: Analysis of how each prompt performed with scores
6. **Prompt Refinement**: Description of how top prompts were refined
7. **Final Evaluation**: Analysis of the refined prompts' performance
8. **Comparison of Rounds**: Which round produced better prompts and why
9. **Final Result**: The best prompt with detailed explanation
10. **Conclusion**: Key takeaways and lessons learned

IMPORTANT: Make sure to compare the best scores from the first evaluation round to the final evaluation round. The best prompt should be chosen from either round based on which had the highest score, not automatically from the refined prompts.

For each section:
- Include relevant data from the provided information
- Create tables, lists, and other markdown formatting to enhance readability
- Extract insights from the raw data to provide meaningful analysis
- Use headings, subheadings, and other organizational elements appropriately

Make the report professional, detailed, and suitable for a technical audience while still being accessible.

The report should be comprehensive but focus particularly on the most important aspects of the tuning process and insights gained.
